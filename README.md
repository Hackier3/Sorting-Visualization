# Data visualization in sorting algorithms

Hey, this is my first project using raylib. It was my first attempt to write a program with a larger external library, so this project is not perfect. For now, I will leave it here as it is, and I plan to add the following functionalities in my spare time:

* more sorting algorithms
* sound
* fix window closing in data visualization
* displaying information about a given algorithm during the visualization (e.g. number of comparisons, duration, delay)
* mouse functionality
